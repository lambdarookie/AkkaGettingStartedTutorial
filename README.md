# AkkaGettingStartedTutorial
Getting Started Tutorial (Scala): First Chapter

## Overview
This is just me following along an old Akka tutorial. It can be found at http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0/intro/getting-started-first-scala.html.

## Usage
Just do `sbt run` in the root directory. For me, this didn't work with JDK 8, I had to run it on a machine with JDK 7 installed.
