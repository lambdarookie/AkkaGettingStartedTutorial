// The design we are aiming for is to have one `Master` actor initiating the computation, creating a set of `Worker`
// actors. Then it splits up the work into discrete chunks, and sends these chunks to the different workers in a
// round-robin fashion. The master waits until all the workers have completed their work and sent back results for
// aggregation. When computation is completed the master sends the result to the `Listener`, which prints out the
// result.
